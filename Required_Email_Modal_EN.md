# Documentation for RequiredEmailModal and Associated Components

This documentation outlines the functionality and usage of the `RequiredEmailModal` component along with its associated sub-components: `Attention`, `InputEmail`, `Confirm`, and `ErrorPopup`. Each component plays a role in ensuring users have a confirmed email address.

## Overview

The `RequiredEmailModal` component is designed to prompt users to enter and confirm their email addresses if they haven't already. It interacts with several sub-components to guide users through this process. Here's a breakdown of each component and how they work together.
