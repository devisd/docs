### Description of the `transliterate` Function

The `transliterate` function is designed to convert text written in Cyrillic script into Latin script, taking into account the linguistic peculiarities of Ukrainian and Russian languages.

#### Function Signature:

```javascript
function transliterate(text, language)
```

#### Parameters:

- `text` (`string`): The text to be transliterated.
- `language` (`string`): The language for which transliteration is performed (`'uk'` for Ukrainian, `'ru'` for Russian).

#### Return Value:

- `string`: The transliterated text.

#### Function Description:

1. **Retrieving the Alphabet for Transliteration:** Based on the specified language, the corresponding alphabet is determined.

2. **Checking the Type of Input Text:** The function ensures that the input text is a string. If not, an error message is displayed, and the function returns an empty string.

3. **Determining the Start of a Word:** Using the helper function `isStartOfWord`, it is determined whether the current character marks the beginning of a word (important for applying special transliteration rules).

4. **Applying Language-Specific Transliteration Rules:** Depending on the selected language, specific rules are applied to each character of the text:
   - For Ukrainian:
     - Special rules for the start of a word (`Єє`, `Її`, `Йй`, `Юю`, `Яя`).
     - Rules for the `зг` letter combination.
     - Ignoring the soft sign and adapting foreign words containing the letter `г`.
   - For Russian:
     - Ignoring the soft sign.

5. **Transliterating the Text:** 
   - Splitting the input text into individual characters.
   - Applying transliteration rules to each character.
   - Reassembling the transliterated characters back into a string.

#### Usage Example:

```javascript
const text = "Привіт, світ!";
const transliteratedText = transliterate(text, 'uk');
console.log(transliteratedText); // Output: "Pryvit, svit!"
```

This function is useful for automatically transliterating text written in Cyrillic script into the Latin alphabet, especially in the context of international communications or creating systems that support multilingualism.

### Description of the `TransliterateWidget` Component

#### Overview

The `TransliterateWidget` component is a React component used for transliterating text between Cyrillic and Latin scripts. It is designed to accommodate the specific transliteration rules of Ukrainian and Russian languages.

#### Component Structure

```javascript
const TransliterateWidget = ({ name, placeholder, widget, form }: IDynamicComponent & IWidget) => {
  // Component logic and rendering...
}
```

#### Props

- `name` (`string`): The name of the form field.
- `placeholder` (`string`): Placeholder text for the input field.
- `widget` (`object`): An object containing widget-specific settings (e.g., `upper` for uppercasing the input).
- `form` (`object`): An object representing the form data and methods.

#### Internal State

- `firstValue`, `secondValue`: Store the values of the first and second input fields, respectively.
- `hide`: A boolean to control the visibility of the second input field.
- `transliteratedText`, `transliteratedTextRu`, `transliteratedTextSecond`, `transliteratedTextRuSecond`: Store the transliterated text for different languages.

#### useEffect Hook

- Monitors changes to `firstValue` and `locale`, and updates the transliterated text accordingly.

#### Transliteration Logic

- `handleTransliteration`: Transliterates the input text based on the selected locale.
- `formatText`: Formats text to have each word start with a capital letter.

#### Event Handlers

- `handleChange`: Handles changes in the first input field. It applies formatting and transliteration, and updates the form value.
- `handleChangeSecondChange`: Similar to `handleChange`, but for the second input field. Additionally, it clears the transliteration hints when the input is empty.
- `handleClick`: Handles button clicks for copying the transliterated text back to the input fields.

#### Component Rendering

- Renders two input fields, with the second one being conditionally visible.
- Displays buttons with transliteration suggestions.
- Utilizes `Controller` from `react-hook-form` for form management.

#### Usage Example

```jsx
<TransliterateWidget
  name="text"
  placeholder="Enter text here"
  widget={{ upper: false }}
  form={formInstance}
/>
```

This component is beneficial in scenarios where text needs to be transliterated between Cyrillic and Latin alphabets, such as in multilingual applications or for users unfamiliar with Cyrillic keyboards. It provides a user-friendly interface for transliteration, helping to bridge language barriers in text input.
